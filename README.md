A project having to do with clocks and such...

This project provides a console application that calculates the required travel of an abstract clock's
minute hand from one time to another.

This app can be built using Scala's simple build tool (SBT) and tested and run with version 2.9.2 of scala
on top of a bootstrapped 1.7 version of Oracle's OpenJDK. I expect it would work equally well with a 1.6
JDK. All dependencies are available automagically in the build file.
