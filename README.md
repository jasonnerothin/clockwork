clockwork

A project having to do with clocks and such...

Prerequisites
-------------
1. SBT installed and ready to go.

Description
-----------

This project provides a console application that calculates the required travel of an abstract clock's
minute hand from one time to another.

Ancillary details
-----------------

This app can be built using Scala's simple build tool (SBT) and tested and run with version 2.9.2 of scala
on top of a bootstrapped 1.7 version of Oracle's OpenJDK. I expect it would work equally well with a 1.6
JDK.

To Run
------

To run the application, open a command window in the project directory and type 'sbt'. Then, type
'run-main Main' (no quotes) and hit enter. A number of other useful SBT tasks are available such as 'test',
'compile', 'package', 'reload', etc...
